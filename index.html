            <ol>
                <li>Are you currently employed?
                    <ul><li>No, I am not currently employed. I am searching for a job. I am not sitting idle at home though. I keep myself busy with learning and building personal projects.</li></ul>
                </li>

                <li>What are the responsibilities of a web developer?
                    <ul><li>I think it mainly depends on the company. Each company gives it's web developers unique things to do. I believe web developers build websites, web apps, APIs, as well as make sure the finished products are optimized, quick and up to standard.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>What sparked your interest in web development?
                    <ul><li>I think it is extremely satisfying to build something that others can use. I like it because it is creative. The only limit in what I can build is my own mind.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Have you ever disagreed with a coworker? Tell me about it and how you resolved it.
                    <ul><li>Yes, I have. I worked at a restaurant and some new people were hired. I was one of the people in charge of training the new hires. Time went on and they got very good at the job. One of the guys I had trained told me one day that I could get messy when working. At first, I was indignant. Upon further reflection, I realized that he was right. He was a very tidy person, so I started observing his tidy habits and emulating them. I would say I improved tremendously in tidyness.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Tell what is W3C and why is it important?
                    <ul><li>It is a group of organizations and individuals in charge of developing and maintaining standards for the web. It ensures compatibility, accessibility, collaboration and ensuring that different components and parts of the web work together.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Explain how you optimize and reduce web application load time.
                    <ul><li>By reducing http requests, optimize images, use caching, code efficiency(reduce unused code). I also go to https://pagespeed.web.dev  to see where I could improve performance. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>What are the differences of using HTTP/2 as opposed to HTTP 1.1?
                    <ul><li>Http/2 is faster and more efficient. Developers have control over prioritization. Instead of the data being sent one after another, and waiting for client response, it’s sent in pieces all at once. Each data stream is assigned a weighted value, and the client assembles them together using the values. Therefore, the developer can determine which content is more important to the user and that gets loaded first. Http/2 uses multiplexing so that pieces of data don’t block others from being loaded. It uses server push(the server pushes content without being asked for it), and header compression using HPACK</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>In what programming languages are you proficient?
                    <ul><li>I would say I’m proficient in Java, JavaScript and PHP as well as CSS and HTML. I do have some experience in Angular, React, and Dart. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you optimize CSS for performance?
                    <ul><li>CSS can be optimized by measuring the site’s performance using a performance tool like PageSpeed Insights or built in browser network and performance tools. Optimize rendering(remove unused styles, break CSS into modules, minify and compress CSS, simplify selectors, use CSS sprites, handle animations, use HTTP preload and push, lazy loading</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you handle feedback and criticism?
                    <ul><li>I use feedback and criticism to improve myself. I use them as guiding stones on what would be beneficial for me to work on. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you manage your time and stay productive while working remotely?
                    <ul><li>I’ve a schedule I follow daily. Every hour is planned and at any time, I know what I should be working on. All tasks are assigned a time in which they should be done. This helps me stay on top of things, therefore, it keeps me productive.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you prioritize your work as a Web Developer?
                    <ul><li>I ask myself what’s the most important work I could be doing at any given moment. This cuts out ‘fluff’ work and I do the web development that needs to get done. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Can you walk me through your most recent project, highlighting the technologies you used?
                    <ul><li>I was building the backend of a todo app using Node.js. I created the http requests, checked via postman that the data was accurate, and displayed the data. I used postman, express, body-parser, uuid. I use Git to keep track of my projects.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you ensure your code is clean and maintainable?
                    <ul><li>I make sure that it’s not bloated with redundant code. I also use refactoring, descriptive names, clear comments, small functions and adhere to standards. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you stay updated with the latest web development trends and technologies?
                    <ul><li>Every now and then I’ll read developer blogs and newsletters, as well as watch YouTube videos of people who are excellent in their various fields. I also use LinkedIn to see what people in my circle are up to tech-wise. I build side projects if some new tech intrigues me. This is to test it out.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you approach API design and development?
                    <ul><li>First determine what the API is going to do as well as the target audience, design it’s contract(endpoints, request and response formats, data types), use the design contract to develop the backend, test it with mock servers, and then document the API. Next I would continue to monitor it and optimize if needed. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How would you optimize the performance of a slow-loading web page?
                    <ul><li>I reduce the page’s size, reduce HTTP requests, optimize images and my HTML, minimize CSS and JavaScript, use a CDN, and use caching</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is your experience with React, Angular, or Vue?
                    <ul><li>I have some experience with Angular and React, but not Vue. But I’m a quick learner and will be able to learn it on the job. I interned with AppToSucceed and we used Angular to build an app. I used React to build side projects. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you handle JavaScript errors and debugging?
                    <ul><li>I use ESLint for validation. Then I use the browser developer tools to detect errors. I also use console.log and console.error as well as conditionals, try and catch, and throw. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>How much will you require per hour if you are being hired for this position?
